# Code Challenge 3:

## Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.

# Challenge
    Build a linked list and Add to it nodes also check if values are inside the linked list or not

# Approach & Efficiency
    The Efficiency of the Big O time is O(n)
