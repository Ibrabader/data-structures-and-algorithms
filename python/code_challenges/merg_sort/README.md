# Code Challenge 27

## Marge Sort
  * Merge sort works by splitting the input list into two halves, repeating the process on those halves, and finally merging the two sorted halves together.

## Challenge Summary
  * Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code.
  * Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language.
  * Present a complete set of working tests.

## Approach & Efficiency
  * Time: O(n.logn)
    - Because the list is being split in log(n) calls and the merging process takes linear time in each call.
  * Space: O(1)
    - This list is being sorted in place, keeping the space at constant O(1).
